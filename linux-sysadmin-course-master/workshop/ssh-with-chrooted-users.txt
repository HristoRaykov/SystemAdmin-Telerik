SSH With chrooted users
- create a basic chroot environment(it should have, bash, cp, mv, ps, sed, awk). You can use busybox if you like.
- create the mounts needed for a few test users
- configure SSH to chroot each user in its new directory
- Directory structure
/
|-home/
|     |-pesho
|     |-mesho
|     \-nesho
|
|-var/
|    |-chroot/
|    |       |-baseos/
|    |       |       |-bin/
|    |       |       |-lib/
|    |       |       \-proc/
|    |       |-pesho
|    |       |-mesho
|    |       \-nesho

Additionally you can:
- create a separate file, create an FS on it and use it to store the baseos
- instead of using file, you can use tmpfs for your baseos
- create an init script for the mounts
	- if you decided to make any of the above two options, include their mounts in the script
	- mount each user on boot
