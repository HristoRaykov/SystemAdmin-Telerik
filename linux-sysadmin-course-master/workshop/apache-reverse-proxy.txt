Setup Apache web server.
Add one additional IP to your container.
Add virtual host on that additional IP.
Add a virtual host on the main IP.
Configure the main IP vhost to be a reverse proxy for the secondary IP. Make sure that the IPs logged in the logs for the secondary vhost are NOT the IPs of the container it self.
